ISES (In Silico Evolution System) was written as a final project for a 
graduate class in evolutionary computation (COMP 5206 at Carleton 
University). It's here mostly for reference. Basically, the idea was to 
implement the system described by 
[Jenkins and Stekel, 2010](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-010-9369-4), 
in which the  authors use GAs with biologically realistic mutation 
operators (such as, gene duplication and deletion) to evolve 
hierarchical gene regulatory networks. I had grand plans of extending 
the system in various ways, but it took too long just to get it to work. 
(Rocked an A+ on it, so it couldn't have been that bad.)

I've included the original write-up from the project, so there's no need 
to describe it at length here.  It was a fun project, and one that I'll 
likely come back to at some point.
